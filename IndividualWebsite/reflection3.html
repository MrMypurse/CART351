    <h2>REFLECTION 3</h2>
    <h4> Reading: The birth of AJAX, an amazing story. Techtracer. March 3, 2007.
  </h4>
  <h5>
      <p>The article presents the story behind the evolution of AJAX technology. The success of AJAX started with Microsoft and Google. Microsoft had created the XMLHTTP ActiveX object its Outlook Web Access 2000 release. Mozilla quickly incorporated it into its browser. Google soon created Gmail also using XMLHTTP, which was the first most interactive web-based email client using a rich internet interface. It was also free of cost. Google Map was also successful by allowing users to locate and view places on any point across the world all in the same browser. The article claims that Google is the father of all AJAX inventions. It also refers to Jesse James Garrett, who is the founder of Adaptive Path. He defines AJAX as multiple technologies in one: CSS, Document Object Model, XMLHTTP, XML and XSLT. The invention of AJAX has changed the notion of web design, it unlocks infinite potentials of creativity that we can implement on webpages. There are many tools available today for web developers to use AJAX to its full potential, such as the programming language Ruby. AJAX is only taking the internet to further heights in the future. This reading is short yet informative. It is also relevant to what I am doing in my final project. I also find it interesting that the popularity of AJAX started with emails on web, like Microsoft Outlook. I didnâ€™t know anything about AJAX before taking this course, and I had no idea how powerful it is as a tool in web design.
