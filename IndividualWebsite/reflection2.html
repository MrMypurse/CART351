    <h2>REFLECTION 2</h2>
    <h4> Reading: The web's greatest minds explain how we can fix the internet, Wired, November 2017
  </h4>
  <h5>
      <p>The article is composed with various people’s opinion on how we can fix the internet to be better. It starts by differentiating the web invented 30 years and the web today. Today’s web is dominated by massive corporations, collecting our data and spreading false information to foster our emotional response to generate revenue. The article focuses on taking the ownership of our data by decoupling data from apps. Users should be able to decide whether they want to share their data and whom to share with. Lanier brings up that we need to change the advertise model. Model advertising on the internet is a form of persuasion. The media manipulates our attention and perception. Jardine talks about the purpose of the dark web and it is how the internet is designed to be. To change the internet, we must questions what kinds of values we want to implement into the internet. Kahle talks about how technologies involving web is much more developed today. When the internet becomes a level playing field, we can collectively make it a better space. Wales, the co founder of Wikipedia, argues that Apple has complete control of what goes on in the iOS store. The company has the market power to eliminate any competitor who wants to put apps in the iOS store. Professor Hall brings up that changing the system might have a downside. Separating internet by different regions might cause certain problems. Chinese government has been using internet to censor free speech and promoting propagandas. Overall, there are many things we need to fix about the internet. I believe what’s important right now is to raise awareness about personal data protection, since it is an important part of our privacy. We also need to implement more regulations towards how corporation are collecting/ selling our data.
