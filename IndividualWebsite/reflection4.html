    <h2>REFLECTION 4</h2>
    <h4> EXPLORE: Closer to Home: CITYSTUDIO Montreal
  </h4>
  <h5>
      <p>CityStudio Montreal is "an initiative that allows universities and city staff to work together to tackle Montreal's urban challenges". The projects are made by university students with the aid from professors and city staff. And the projects often concern the topic of urban life and the impact of human urban activities on the environment. The artworks make us reflect on problems, such as over consumption, pollution and wastes. Once a year, CityStudio Montreal and city staff identity urban issues that need further insight. The projects are then matched with courses from partnered universities. Students will work with city staff to co-create pilot projects for the benefit of the community. Final projects are launched by students as experiments in the community to test the solutions. The results are also presented at Voil√†! for everyone to share thoughts and implement the most promising of the proposals.

      <p>
        My favorite projects from CityStudio Montreal are "Our Unsustainable Coffee Habits" and "Trouble With Takeout". They both discuss the problem of over consuming and generating too much wastes in the urban life setting, and theses are problems I can personally relate to. I often purchase coffee from big chain cafes like Starbucks and Second Cup. I believe that it would a wake up call for many consumers to see the scale of stack coffee cups. It also has an important intuitive, which is sustainable and responsible consumption. "Trouble with Takeout" is also something I can relate to. My roommate and I often order food on UberEATS/Door dash. But we have never thought about the damage that the food packaging might have on the environment. I think it is important to educate and spread the awareness that we need to reduce the amount of wastes that goes into the landfill and support more businesses that use environmentally friendly packaging.
