      <h2>PROJECT PROPOSAL</h2>

      <h3> COMPOST IN CANADA </h3>
      <br>

    <h4>
      <p>My project 3 proposal is a data visualization of the current compost situation in Canada, including statistics that presents the percentages of Canadians who compost regularly, separated by regions, incomes, and etc. The main elements of the
        site will be the various data visualizations, the pop up window with a question that the user must answer, and another page with more information educating the users about the importance of compost. </p>
    </h4>
    <h5>
      <p>My starting topic is compost, but I might also incorporate recycling if I have time. It is important for me because I have learnt a lot about composting during my quarantine in summer. My mother and I have been using a lot of organic waste
        in our garden. I also think that this topic should be important for others, because actions to affect our environment takes more than one person. Composting diverts materials from landfills and adds something beneficial to the environment.
        But for composting to be actually beneficial to the planet, we have to make a collective effort as a community. Therefore, I think that we should all be aware of how to compost, or if we don’t have time/ tools to compost, at least we should
        understand the connection between waste, compost and recycles. Lastly, I find it important to make this topic into an explora le networked space, because visualized data is much easier to consume than boring numbers and statistics. Our manner
        of digesting information is so fast right now, that visuals will leave a much deeper impression than text/numbers.
      </p>
      <p>I want to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society by making the users a part of the data in the beginning. I will have a pop up page when the user enters the website to ask whether they
        compost. Everyone can make their own decisions when it comes to discarding their waste, but I want to encourage users to reflect on how their decisions can affect the environment, even when they are the smallest actions.
      </p>
      <p>I hope that my space can help educating the users about the importance of composting and the impact of our actions on the environment. And I also hope that i can challenge the users to look at how they discard their waste. My space should
        also enable collaboration between the users in a way that they can see the statistics within their region.</p>

      <h3> THREE RESEARCH PROJECTS </h3>
      <h5>
        <p><a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/WhereTheWildThingsGlow/Tester?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes&:toolbar=no&:origin=viz_share_link&:showVizHome=no"><span class="bold">Where the Wild Things Grow: The Incredible Natural Spectacle of Bioluminescence</span></a> is a Tableau visualization created for National Geographic by Jonni Walker. It has won the Information is Beautiful Awards in 2019 and is used in National Geographic. This visualization uses Tableau and Mapbox to create a map of bioluminescent species found on land and in the oceans on the east coast of Australia. The purpose of this website is to demonstrate the East and South-East coast of Australia, which has the perfect mix of ecosystems and climate to host bioluminescent organisms.The creators explains that the bioluminescence fends off predators, lures prey, attracts mates & can aid pollination. Mushrooms may spread their spores by using luminescence to entice insects to land on them. Although this is not a full site, I find the design and the layout very interesting. The creator incorporates a 3D map with glowing dots to represent different species.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/76461997/The-Geography-of-Human-Rights"><span class="bold">The Geography of Human Right</span></a> is a data visualization created by Federica Fragapane. The visualization shows the Human Rights Protection index (from 1950 to 2014) and the Human Rights Violations index (in 2014) for 50 countries.The countries are sorted along the horizontal axis by GDP per capita and along the vertical axis by population. Each country is represented by a circle of which the size corresponds to the human right violation data. And from the circles ,there are extended lines indicating human right protection by the years. Higher values indicate better human right protections.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.studioterp.nl/a-view-on-despair-a-datavisualization-project-by-studio-terp/"><span class="bold">A View on Despair</span></a> is a data visualization site made by Sonja Kuijpers to shine light on the importance of recognizing depression. It has won the Information is Beautiful Awards in 2019. The site has the beautiful visual of a landscape with clouds, trees, water and stars. But each element in the landscape represents a person who committed suicide in the Netherlands in the year 2017. Each category/method of suicide is represented by a certain element: the tree means hanging/strangulation, the cloud means taking drugs/ alcohol/medicine, the building means jumping from height, and etc. The creator hopes to use visual information to point out the pain, the shame, the fear that people are going through. Since she went through depression herself and has reflected on taken her own life, she wishes to help people in the similar situation and let them know that depression should be taken seriously: “I really wish that we can all find peace by insight, appreciation, dealing with and hopefully enjoy living our lives, not by ending it.”
