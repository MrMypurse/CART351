    <h2>REFLECTION 1</h2>
    <h4> Reading: Richard Seymour, The machine always wins: what drives our addiction to social media, The Guardian, August 23 2019 </h3>
  </h4>
  <h5>
      <p>In this reading, Richard Seymour demonizes social media platforms in an almost poetic way. He focuses on the phenomenon of “social media addiction” and compares the way that social medias are designed to many mediums casinos and slot machines that are designed to encourage gambling: blocking the sense of time out of users and giving the users a sense of regular wins to avoid social reality. Social media addiction is linked to increased depression, it indexes both the pleasure of intoxication and the danger of having too much, it is something dangerous that could wreck our lives. Seymour also compares social media addictions to extreme cases like heroin addicts and compulsive gamblers. He brings up Mary Beard, a historian who couldn’t pull herself out of social media discussions and who keeps returning to the platforms that hurt her the most, as an example of social media addicts. He describes such action as a form of digital self-harm. Finally, he points out that the manipulation will not stop, it turns us into numbers in the market demographics. And us, the users, are the one to bring the toxicity to the platforms.
      </p>
      <P>I think that Richard Seymour has valid reasonings behind why manipulative algorithms will always win against human mind: it is in bedded in our addictive nature. For example, the “cancel culture” reveals an ugly part of humanity itself. Not to mention how social media platforms act as enhancers for massive corporations to manipulate users. People become both the attackers and the victims under the context of social medias.  But I know that the machine themselves are not evil, and the users themselves aren’t evil, either. The creators of any social media platform do not create algorithms with the intention of ruin relationship and people’s lives. The society itself has the responsibility, collectively, to guide itself through the social media phenomenon that has never happened in human history. The digital era is novel to all of us, and all users are responsible to stay aware of its effects and treat each other with the purest intention and respect online.
